Quantitative Analysis in the stock market is a financial methodology that utilizes mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze stocks and financial markets. Below is a detailed description of the process for performing Quantitative Analysis on stock market data using Python, along with specific numerical insights derived from the analysis.

#### Process Overview

1. **Objective Definition**
   - Clearly define the objectives and questions to be answered by the analysis.

2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Identification**
   - Identify the relevant KPIs, such as stock prices, trading volumes, and other financial indicators.

3. **Data Collection**
   - Gather historical stock market data, including prices, volumes, and other relevant financial indicators.

4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset.

5. **Initial Data Analysis**
   - Understand data distributions, patterns, and correlations through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

6. **Strategy Implementation**
   - Develop and implement various strategies based on the quantitative analysis.

### Data Description

The dataset used in the analysis includes the following columns:
- **Ticker**: The stock ticker symbol.
- **Date**: The trading date.
- **Open**: The opening price of the stock for the day.
- **High**: The highest price of the stock during the day.
- **Low**: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock for the day.
- **Adj Close**: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for corporate actions such as dividends and stock splits.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded during the day.

3. **Volatility Analysis**
   - Calculating and comparing the standard deviation of the closing prices for each stock.
   - Results:
     - **NFLX**: Standard Deviation ≈ 18.55 (highest volatility)
     - **MSFT**: Standard Deviation ≈ 17.68
     - **AAPL**: Standard Deviation ≈ 7.36
     - **GOOG**: Standard Deviation ≈ 6.28 (lowest volatility)

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Understanding how the stock prices of different companies are related to each other.
   - Correlation matrix heatmap shows:
     - Positive correlations among all stocks, with some pairs having stronger correlations.
     - Example: AAPL and MSFT have a relatively higher positive correlation.

5. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Comparing the performance of different stocks based on their returns over the period.
   - Percentage change in closing prices from start to end of the period:
     - **MSFT**: +16.10% (highest positive change)
     - **AAPL**: +12.23%
     - **GOOG**: -1.69% (slight negative change)
     - **NFLX**: -11.07% (most significant negative change)

6. **Daily Risk Vs. Return Analysis**
   - Calculating the average daily return and the standard deviation of daily returns for each stock.
   - Results:
     - **AAPL**: Low risk, positive average daily return.
     - **GOOG**: Higher volatility, slightly negative average daily return.
     - **MSFT**: Moderate risk, highest average daily return.
     - **NFLX**: Highest risk, negative average daily return.
